# SSCA Dashboard

A lightweight dashboard application built with Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS and Recharts. This repository contains the frontend app and build output generated by Next.js.

## Key Technologies

- Next.js (app directory)
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- PostCSS / Autoprefixer
- Recharts (charts)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- lucide-react (icons)

## Requirements

- Node.js (use a modern LTS; Node 18/20 recommended)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

## Install

1. Clone the repo

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Environment

- Copy `.env.local` from your environment template if needed (this repo may include an `.env.local` for local secrets/config).

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start development server (Next.js dev)
- `npm run build` — build for production
- `npm run start` — run production server after build
- `npm run lint` — run Next.js lint
- `npm run test` — placeholder test script (exits with error by default)

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Build & Production

Build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the compiled app:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Project Structure (high level)

- `app/` — Next.js App Router source (pages/route handlers, layout, and global styles)
- `public/` — static assets (if present)
- `.next/` — Next.js build output (generated)
- `package.json` — scripts and dependencies
- `postcss.config.mjs` — PostCSS configuration

## Notes

- Dependencies are defined in `package.json`. This project uses Next.js 16 and React 19 with Tailwind CSS and PostCSS.
- The repository contains a generated `.next` folder (build/dev output). You typically don't commit that in development workflows.
